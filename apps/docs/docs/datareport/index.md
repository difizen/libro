# overview

In data analysis and report production, libro offers an innovative way of working. When we use SQL and Python cells for data processing in libro, we can easily convert the notebook into a complete, structured report by hiding the input part of the notebook and showing only the Markdown text and output results. This not only ensures the traceability of the analysis process, but also presents the results in a concise visual effect, providing a clear and professional analysis report.
