# overview

Quant Export is an AI agent born to assist quantitative research, simulates and assists the daily workflow of quantitative financial engineering researchers, integrates AI into quantitative financial engineering investment research, and makes quantitative investment more efficient, smarter and better.

## information extraction

### Multimodal information extraction

Quantitative knowledge, methodology and research framework exist in a large number of research reports, tables and pictures. With the help of multi-modal information extraction capabilities, key information is quickly extracted and structured output is carried out.

### Quantitative information construction completion

Some factors and data calculations are not driven by external information sources, but may come from an idea or a simple description input, which can be constructed and completed according to the framework.

## code generation

### Proprietary Tool classes - Quantitative tool API directed generation

For tools, data class usage application everything. The open source version of AntAlpha integrates some quantitative tools and will continue to be optimized and improved.

### Framework Guidance Class - Code directed generation to fit expert frameworks and requirements

The link of code quality inspection is increased. By increasing the testing and trial running of fragments, the possible problem code is intercepted, and the correct version is optimized and returned, so as to improve the end-to-end controllability and balance the natural romance of large models with the precision and controllability of code generation tasks.

### Generic code helper classes

Quick support for general-purpose basic python programming assistance issues.

### Knowledge selection, expansion and customization

Default data, API packages, intentions, and code frameworks all support custom upload, modification, and expansion, which can quickly adapt to different data, API dependencies, and forms.

## Quantitative report generation

### Analysis of factor backtest results

According to the results of quantization calculation and backtest, the quantization report is generated according to the class template.

## Quantitative report generation

### Quantitative universal retrieval

The inspiration that needs to be verified in quantitative research, the card points encountered, the knowledge boundaries that need to be extended, and the real-time data that needs to be obtained quickly, assisted retrieval can provide support outside the code.
